# TOTEM CASE

Each half consists of a bottom and a top part (with an integrated switchplate) and is meant to be 3D printed in resin. 

I got good results from [JLCPCB](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote) (15€ + tax and shipping for a black or white version) and [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/manufacture/?type=2&reffercode=TOP) (50€ + tax and shipping for a clear case).

Where possible use the STEP files, but the STL files should be fine too.

If you're sure you only will use the wired version you can also use the case without a power switch (USB) or use the case without a TRRS cutout if you plan on using the wireless version (BLE).

> **Note**
> The manufacturer will probably warn you about too thin sections, but it worked fine for me since these sections are pretty small.

## Tenting

Tenting is possible using the provided bottom plates found in the tenting folder. These bottom plates are compatible with their corresponding non-tenting top part. The tenting bottom plates are compatible with the same screws as the non-tenting bottom plates.

> **Note**
>Using these tenting bottom plates (left) the keyboard height will be increased by the thickness of the tenting feet (around 4mm). Compared to the default bottom plate (right).


The tenting bottom plates are designed for [these laptop risers](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005005605228469.html).
These are attached using the provided adhesive and sit flush with the bottom of the plate.

This system enables two tenting options: 13 and 20 degrees.
The feet allow for an even higher tenting option but this is not officially supported due to design constrains for top piece compatibility.

For optional extra grip whilst tenting there is a recess made at the pinky key designed for anti-slip adhesive pads, such as [this one](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005005377684110.html)
