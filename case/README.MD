# TOTEM CASE

Each half consists of a bottom and a top part (with an integrated switchplate) and is meant to be 3D printed in resin. 

I got good results from [JLCPCB](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote) (15€ + tax and shipping for a black or white version) and [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/manufacture/?type=2&reffercode=TOP) (50€ + tax and shipping for a clear case).

Where possible use the STEP files, but the STL files should be fine too.

If you're sure you only will use the wired version you can also use the case without a power switch (USB) or use the case without a TRRS cutout if you plan on using the wireless version (BLE).

> **Note**
> The manufacturer will probably warn you about too thin sections, but it worked fine for me since these sections are pretty small.

## Tenting

Tenting is possible using the provided bottom plates found in the tenting folder. These bottom plates are compatible with their corresponding non-tenting top part. The tenting bottom plates are compatible with the same screws as the non-tenting bottom plates.

> **Note**
>Using these tenting bottom plates (left) the keyboard height will be increased by the thickness of the tenting feet (around 4mm). Compared to the default bottom plate (right).


The tenting bottom plates are designed for [these laptop risers](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005005605228469.html).
These are attached using the provided adhesive and sit flush with the bottom of the plate.

This system enables two tenting options: 13 and 20 degrees.
The feet allow for an even higher tenting option but this is not officially supported due to design constrains for top piece compatibility.

For optional extra grip whilst tenting there is a recess made at the pinky key designed for anti-slip adhesive pads, such as [this one](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005005377684110.html)

## Resin Print

According to theoretical research, the resins at JLCPCB have the following "meaning" (copied from Gemini):

When choosing a resin for your keyboard case, toughness and resistance to impact are key, as you want a case that holds up to daily use. Here's a prioritized list of JLCPCB's resins that fit the bill:

* CBY Resin: This appears to be the most robust option. Based on its very high impact strength and elongation at break, it's designed to be extremely tough and less likely to shatter. It's an excellent choice if the "off-white" color works for your design.
* 8228 Resin: This resin is an excellent, robust choice. With very good impact strength (42 J/m), it offers strong resistance against bumps and drops, making it highly suitable for a durable keyboard case.
* Ledo 6060 Resin: Another very solid choice for your case. It also boasts good toughness and impact resistance, ensuring your keyboard is well-protected.
* Imagine Black Resin: If you prioritize a deep black, premium finish and are willing to pay a bit more, this is a superb option. It combines great aesthetics with good overall robustness.
* 9600 Resin: A solid all-rounder. While it might not match the top-tier impact resistance of the resins above, it's still described as "durable" and is a good choice for a stable and reliable case.
* 8001 Resin: If you're looking for a transparent or translucent case, this is your best bet. Just be aware that it might not be as impact-resistant as the "tougher" opaque resins.
* X Resin: Its unpredictable color and properties make it unsuitable for a finished product like a keyboard case.
